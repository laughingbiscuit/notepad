# Hello World

A short description explaining the content of this post.

## Section 1

There are some goals here:

- do something
- do something else

Usually we would write latin here, but I am very modern.

## Section 2

There will also be code:

```sh
echo "Hello World"
```

and nice tables:

| Environment 	| Purpose		 |
|---------------|------------------------|
| dev		| an unstable environment for developers to use against mocks |
| intg		| an unstable environment for developers to use against unstable backends |
| perf		| a dedicated environment for performance testing |
| uat		| a semi-stable environment for product owners to sign off |
| preprod	| a prod-like environment for hotfixes and smoke testing of env config |
| sandbox	| a prod-like environment with stubbed backends |
| prod		| where the magic happens |
